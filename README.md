## Description
AWS-Thought is a full stack AWS Cloud Application where users can share their thoughts and post images. The backend API was built out with DynamoDB. Images are converted to URLs with multer and stored into an S3 bucket. The frontend is built out as a React SPA with a simple UI. The application was deployed to an EC2 instance by connecting to the SSH Client through a Virtual Machine command line, following best practices. Share your thoughts with the world with this easy-to-use application.
